# [ICLR2026 Oral (top 1.2%)] DepthLM
Official implementation of "[DepthLM: Metric Depth from Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)".


We show for the first time that **VLMs can achieve comparable accuracy with pure vision models on metric depth estimation**, with standard text-based SFT and no architecture chagne, i.e., no dense prediction head or regression/regularization loss is needed. Such simplicity allows DepthLM to train a unified VLM to handle various complex 3D understanding tasks such as speed or time estimation, and metric scale camera pose estimation, which require different architecture or hand-crafted pipelines in pure vision models.

## Data Preparation
- For each training/eval dataset, we curate them into
    - A folder containing the images
    - A jsonl file containing the corresponding camera intrinsics and 3D labels
- We provide example data from the iBims1 dataset at examples/ibims1 for quick code run without the need of data preparation. Other images/datasets can use the same code after finishing the data preparation steps.
- Due to legal reasons, we cannot directly release the curated data. However, we provide the data curation code to enable reproduction.
- Checkout each block in [prepare_data.sh](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DepthLM_Official/blob/main/prepare_data.sh) for the detailed data preparation steps on each dataset.

## Eval
- run ```bash eval.sh <path_to_your_model>```


## Training
- Download the base model you want to train from [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct/tree/main). Our code currently supports Qwen2.5-VL and Pixtral, please see our paper for the corresponding hyper-parameters.
- run ```bash train.sh <path_to_your_model> <output_path>```
